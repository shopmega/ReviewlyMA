## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, desaturated blue (#89B9C9) to inspire trust and transparency in the platform. This choice acknowledges the themes of insight and information that the app will be focused on.
- Background color: Light, off-white background (#F5F5F5) for readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Subtle, muted green (#A0D6B4) for positive actions and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a modern yet approachable feel, ensuring readability across the platform. If 'Space Grotesk' is requested, the website will need more 'modern computerized design' but 'PT Sans' is also a valid choice.
- Use clear, professional icons for ratings, categories, and actions to enhance usability.
- Clean and structured layout with clear sections for company profiles, reviews, and search functions.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations for user interactions (e.g., review submission, search results).
